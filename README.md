# Premier-League-Player-Analysis
This program is a tool that can be used to analyze Premier League soccer player data over the seasons 2014/15 to 2018/19. The data points that this program uses have been acquired from Understat.com. My brother Owen and I created text files unique to 20 different players with data points extracted from this website to be read into the program. This program reads in data about a user specified player, including years played (2014/15 to 2018/19), appearances made, goals scored, assists, expected goals, and expected assists. (as a reminder, expected goals and assists are statistics in soccer calculated based on a number of factors, such as the angle towards the goal and proximity to the goal, describing the statistical likelihood of a certain shot becoming a goal or a certain pass becoming an assist). It then gives the option for the user to see a summary of the player's statistics, a bar graph of goals vs expected goals for each year, and finally a bar graph of assists vs expected assists for each year. This project was created in Python, and was joint-coded by my brother Owen, and I. This project was completed in the fall of 2019 and was uploaded at a later date.
