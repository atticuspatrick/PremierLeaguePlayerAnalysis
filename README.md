# Premier-League-Player-Analysis
Final Project for CS 021 (Introduction to Python). This program is a tool that can be used to analyze Premier League soccer player data over the seasons 2014/15 to 2018/19. The data points that this program uses have been acquired from Understat.com. My brother Owen and I created text files unique to 20 different players with data points extracted from this website to be read into the program. This program reads in data about a user specified player, including years played (2014/15 to 2018/19), appearances made, goals scored, assists, expected goals, and expected assists. This project was created in Python, and was joint-coded by my brother Owen, and I, in our introductory Python class. This project was completed in the fall of 2019 and uploaded at a later date.
